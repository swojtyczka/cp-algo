# Competitive programming algorithms

This is a subset of competitive programming algorithms that I used in contests and for teaching.

***Some of these algorithms were originally written back when I was just starting to learn DSA, so they may not meet current standards. I'm actively reviewing and refining each one. Finished algorithms are marked with ✅***
